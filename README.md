The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

Hello Human 🖖🏽

My name is Mariana and I am an accountant by profession willing to gain knowledge into programming and have the opportunity of being part of an AI project that can improve people's lives somehow (SOMEDAY!). 

With this goal in mind, I decided to make a little twist in my professional life so I started the Data Science path in Codecademy covering topics like SQL, Python, Pandas, Machine Learning (Today 04/16/2020 @ 40%/100%).

During this process, I've been excited, frustrated, happy, and with the feeling that the more I learn the less I know but I keep going positive. 🙃
